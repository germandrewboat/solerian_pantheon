    "description": "At the dawn of civilization, the gods squabbled and disagreed on how to oversee their new world and the burgeoning peoples upon it. Each god – with their own domain to watch over – believed that life upon Soleria should be lived a certain way, and that their commandments were the ones that should be followed above all others. This led to a conflict between the gods, a celestial war that shook the earth. History called it the “Many Gods War,” and it was a majority of the Solerian denizens’ introduction to the pantheon that existed around them. During the Many Gods War, several of the beings were killed. The essence of these dead gods was spread throughout the planes, their final resting places a mystery. Their domains were absorbed into the rest of the pantheon that remained.",

Her followers prove their worth by hunting the most dangerous beasts they can find, and those that do become her champions, and can bestow blessings onto the weapons of another hunter. Her champions often find a good hunt to consist of delving deep into the earth and seeking out the underground creatures protected by the followers of Osti. Her followers also often seek out the horrible creations of Mahluq.",

She openly opposed the then-current God of Death, Droka, and his malevolent rule of the domain. After taking power, and displacing Droka from the pantheon, she sought to bring an end to the fear of death. She teaches that death is natural and cannot be avoided, and to undo death is a great crime of nature and order. She barely communicates with the denizens of the world, but rewards those who fight in her name to correct undeath by making them her champions. Graveyards typically serve as her “temples,” and her followers sometimes watch over them or even live in them.",

She often receives praise when a wanderer finds a detour in their path and takes it as a sign to take a road less traveled, and they are usually up to the challenge set before them. Temples to her are usually glorified shrines that require little upkeep, and most are made upon landmarks out at sea.",

Bards are quite common worshippers of Sanat. Often, the first challenge set to a bard studying at college is to create something that depicts their love of the deity. They are encouraged to create anything that expresses this feeling and are told to not worry about what their piece says. Creation is freedom. Temples to Sanat also function as museums, music halls, or academies for the arts. Creators that output large amounts of work are revered among her followers as high priests of her order and are often sought after for lessons and teaching.",

Merchants often find his smaller temples and shrines among busy marketplaces to make small offerings of coin or handmade baubles before their daily activities. It is not always uncommon for those leaving a small amount of coin to take one of the baubles in exchange, or vice-versa. His larger temples and his most dedicated servants that oversee them are fabulously wealthy. This wealth is moved and shared among his temples, as some of his followers are also money lenders – fair, but tough negotiators and salesmen.",

Flowers and blooming trees are usually seen by her followers as signs of her beauty in the world. Her followers keep extravagant gardens as a sign of loyalty. Her followers are rarely found in cities, as those stand as affronts to nature, and often make their homes far from the trappings of civilization. They work within and around the natural world and are taught by great matrons of her order to use the earth and Tabat’s domain to their advantage without harming it or altering it too much. Her temples are not things built, but places of hallowed ground, or natural sanctuaries made in places where nature has developed uniquely. Tabat is typically upheld as the most beautiful being in all of creation.",

She is absolutely evil and endlessly malicious and knows no mercy or forgiveness. She delights in the suffering of others, even her own followers. Her endless pride causes her to believe she is above all others, and she tolerates no dishonor or disloyalty. She grants absolutely no favor but promises endless power to the heads of her order, merely to watch them all fight over what she will never give. Her temples are scarce, except for on Soleria, where her followers are plenty. She holds no love for any others, nor calls any ally. She is the great enemy to all.",

It’s often considered that followers of Yolgon are more dangerous to each other than anyone else. However, those that follow the Tides of Chaos are numerous, and include powerful thieves’ guilds and assassin’s guilds, as well as a major cult that seeks to see Yolgon supplant Yulduz as the God of Knowledge so that it can be disseminated to only the worthy. He tends to not have temples, as his followers usually worship in secret.",

Ignorance is the true enemy, even when it comes to hidden, lost, or forbidden knowledge. It is no surprise then that her followers strongly oppose those that follow the Tides of Chaos, Yolgon. When Bilim, the previous god of knowledge, died in the Many Gods War, Yolgon attempted to seize the domain for himself, but Yulduz was stronger following the war, and kept the greedy god from it. The addition of a fourth domain taxed the god, and her followers fear that the more knowledge that is lost or remains undiscovered, the weaker she will become, and Yolgon may see an opportunity to strike. Her clerics and wizards see the bright stars and the bright moon of the night sky as a symbol of Yulduz bringing light to the hidden and the unknown. She also oversees the seasons as, with new knowledge, the world must change. Her followers typically build and keep up libraries in her name.",
